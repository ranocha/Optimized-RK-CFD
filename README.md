## Abstract

We discuss and compare adaptive step size control based on CFL numbers and
error estimates for discontinuous spectral element semidiscretizations of
conservation laws and related problems in computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
We demonstrate the importance of choosing adequate controller
parameters and provide a means to obtain these in practice.
We develop optimized explicit low-storage Runge-Kutta methods with embedded error
estimators for CFD, combined with good step size controllers.
The performance of these new methods is demonstrated in several numerical
experiments with increasing physical complexity.
